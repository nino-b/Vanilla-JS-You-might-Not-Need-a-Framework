# Vanilla JS: You Might Not Need a Framework

## Introduction
Welcome! This repository shows my journey through ["Maximiliano Firtman's"](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/firt/) ["Vanilla JS: You Might Not Need a Framework"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vanilla-js-apps/) workshop.

## About the Workshop
This workshop teaches how we can build rich web apps and websites without depending on libraries or frameworks, using only the core JavaScript language. The course covers fundamental concepts like the DOM API, finding and modifying elements in the DOM, and event handling. The course shows practical examples by building a real web app, "Coffee Masters," to demonstrate advanced topics like SPA routing, web components and shadow DOM, and reactive programming with proxies.
